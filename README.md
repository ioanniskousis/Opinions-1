## N+1 Problem

  The n+1 problem is encountered in this project into multiple case.  
  In order to avoid server's overhead, in some cases it has been solved by using aggregated SQL statements and in some other scopes of models.  

  ### Examples in Class User

  ### Aggregation examples

  ```

      def self.sort_by_friendly
        User.find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, users.username, users.fullname,
                                  count(flds.id) fd
                          FROM users
                          LEFT JOIN followings flds ON users.id = flds.follower_id
                          GROUP BY users.id, users.username, users.fullname
                          ORDER BY fd DESC")
      end

      def self.sort_by_popular
        User.find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, users.username, users.fullname,
                                  count(flrs.id) fr
                          FROM users
                          LEFT JOIN followings flrs ON users.id = flrs.followed_id
                          GROUP BY users.id, users.username, users.fullname
                          ORDER BY fr DESC")
      end

      def self.protagonists
        User.find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, users.username, users.fullname,
                                  count(opinions.id) opinions_count
                          FROM users
                          LEFT JOIN opinions ON users.id = opinions.author_id
                          GROUP BY users.id, users.username, users.fullname
                          ORDER BY opinions_count DESC")
      end

  ```
<hr/>

  ### Scope example

```
    scope :to_follow, ->(user) { where('id NOT IN (?)', user_followed(user)).filter { |f| f.id != user.id } }
```
